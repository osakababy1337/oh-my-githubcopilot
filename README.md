## What is OMG?

**oh-my-githubcopilot (OMG)** brings the multi-agent orchestration paradigm — pioneered by [oh-my-claudecode (OMC)](https://github.com/yeachan-heo/oh-my-claudecode) for Claude Code — to **GitHub Copilot**, now further supercharged with the best features of **[Everything Claude Code (ECC)](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/everything-claude-code)**.

Where OMC supercharges Claude Code with specialized agents and workflow automation, OMG does the same for Copilot's agent mode in VS Code. And with the ECC integration (v1.1.0), OMG now includes ECC's battle-tested patterns: 8 language-specialist reviewer agents, TDD enforcement, rapid security scanning, canonical coding standards, and more. Instead of a single assistant doing everything, OMG coordinates **28 specialized agents** and **22 reusable skills** through an MCP server, giving you structured workflows for planning, execution, review, and verification — all within your existing Copilot setup.

> **This is not a fork or copy of OMC or ECC.** It is an independent implementation built from scratch to leverage GitHub Copilot's agent customization features (`.agent.md`, `.prompt.md`, `SKILL.md`, MCP tools), drawing architectural inspiration from OMC's multi-agent approach and selectively integrating ECC's proven patterns.

---

## Why OMG?

- **Works inside VS Code** — No extra CLI tools, no external processes. Just Copilot agent mode.
- **Specialized agents** — 28 purpose-built agents with scoped access (read-only analysts, full-access executors, 8 language reviewers)
- **Workflow automation** — From autonomous `omg-autopilot` to persistent `ralph` loops to parallel `ultrawork`
- **Safety guardrails** — Pre/post tool-use hooks prevent destructive operations automatically
- **MCP-powered state** — Persistent workflow state, PRD tracking, and project memory across sessions
- **Natural language triggers** — Say "omg-autopilot build me a REST API" and the system handles orchestration
- **Verification-first** — Separate authoring and review passes; claims require evidence

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat enabled
- Agent mode / agent customization support available in your Copilot setup
- Node.js and npm installed so the MCP server can be built locally
- Workspace opened as a trusted folder so MCP, prompts, and customization files can load normally

### Option A: VS Code Extension (Recommended)

1. Install the extension from `.vsix`:
   ```
   code --install-extension oh-my-githubcopilot-1.1.5.vsix
   ```
2. Open your project in VS Code

3. **⚡ Run `OMG: Initialize Workspace` (REQUIRED)**
   ```
   Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) / Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) → "OMG: Initialize Workspace"
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Installing the extension alone is NOT enough.** You must run `OMG: Initialize Workspace` from the Command Palette after installation. This command scaffolds all `.github/` convention files (agents, skills, hooks, prompts, copilot-instructions.md) and builds the MCP server in your workspace. Without this step, Copilot will not have access to any OMG agents or skills.

4. When prompted, click **"Reload Window"** to activate all agents and skills
5. Start using OMG in Copilot Chat (agent mode)

### Option B: Manual Clone

### Step 1: Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmstar85/oh-my-githubcopilot.git
cd oh-my-githubcopilot
```

### Step 2: Build the MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Open in VS Code

Open the project in VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat enabled. The MCP server, agents, skills, and hooks are automatically detected from the workspace configuration.

### Step 4: Start building

In Copilot Chat (agent mode), just say:

```
omg-autopilot: build a REST API for managing tasks
```

That's it. OMG takes over — planning, implementing, reviewing, and verifying.

### Not Sure Where to Start?

If your requirements are vague or you want structured clarification:

```
deep-interview "I want to build a task management app"
```

OMG uses Socratic questioning to surface hidden assumptions and clarify requirements before any code is written.

### Use OMG in Other VS Code Projects

OMG is workspace-scoped, so the recommended way is to apply it per project.

This repository now includes an adoption script:

```bash
scripts/omg-adopt.sh --target <your-project-path> --mode <template|submodule|subtree>
```

#### Tip 1: Template-style for new projects

Use this for greenfield projects where you want OMG files copied directly into the project.

```bash
scripts/omg-adopt.sh --target ~/work/my-new-app --mode template
```

#### Tip 2: Track updates with submodule or subtree

Use one of these when you want a sync strategy for future OMG updates.

```bash
# Submodule strategy
scripts/omg-adopt.sh --target ~/work/my-app --mode submodule

# Subtree strategy
scripts/omg-adopt.sh --target ~/work/my-app --mode subtree
```

What the script applies to the target project:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.github/agents/`
- `.github/skills/`
- `.github/hooks/`
- `.github/prompts/`
- `.vscode/mcp.json`
- `mcp-server/` (with `npm install && npm run build`, unless `--skip-build`)

After applying, open the target project as a trusted workspace and validate in Copilot Chat (agent mode):

```text
/status
```

---

## MCP Server

OMG includes a TypeScript MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides persistent state management for workflows. Registered via `.vscode/mcp.json`, it exposes tools for:

| Tool Group | Tools | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **State** | `omg_read_state`, `omg_write_state`, `omg_clear_state`, `omg_list_active` | Workflow state CRUD and active mode listing |
| **PRD** | `omg_create_prd`, `omg_read_prd`, `omg_update_story`, `omg_verify_story` | PRD creation, story tracking, and verification |
| **Workflow** | `omg_check_completion`, `omg_next_phase`, `omg_get_phase_info` | Phase transitions, completion checks, phase inspection |
| **Memory** | `omg_read_memory`, `omg_write_memory`, `omg_delete_memory` | Project-scoped knowledge persistence |
| **Model Router** | `omg_select_model` | Model recommendation based on task complexity |

State is stored under `.omc/` in the workspace:

```
.omc/
├── state/              # Workflow state files per mode
├── plans/              # Work plans for execution
├── prd.json            # Product Requirements Document
└── project-memory.json # Project-scoped knowledge store
```

---

## Tool Guardrails

OMG includes pre/post tool-use hooks (`.github/hooks/`) that act as safety nets:

**Pre-tool-use guards:**
- Blocks modifications to `node_modules/`
- Prevents direct `.env` file edits
- Stops deletion of critical config files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`)
- Prevents `git push --force` and destructive git operations

**Post-tool-use tracking:**
- Logs tool usage for debugging (`OMG_DEBUG=1`)
- Tracks file modifications for omg-autopilot phase awareness
- Monitors test results for ultraqa detection

```

### How It Works

1. **Instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) define the orchestration rules, delegation logic, and agent catalog
2. **Agents** (`.github/agents/*.agent.md`) are specialized personas with scoped tool access and model preferences
3. **Skills** (`.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`) are workflow routines loaded on-demand via keyword triggers or slash commands
4. **MCP Server** provides persistent state, PRD tracking, and project memory via the Model Context Protocol
5. **Hooks** guard against destructive operations and track execution for workflow awareness

---

## Commit Protocol

OMG uses structured git trailers to preserve decision context:

```
fix(auth): prevent silent session drops during long-running ops

Auth service returns inconsistent status codes on token expiry,
so the interceptor catches all 4xx and triggers inline refresh.

Constraint: Auth service does not support token introspection
Rejected: Extend token TTL to 24h | security policy violation
Confidence: high
Scope-risk: narrow
```

Available trailers: `Constraint`, `Rejected`, `Directive`, `Confidence`, `Scope-risk`, `Not-tested`

## What's New

### v1.1.0 (2026-04-10) — ECC Integration

**Major upgrade: best-of-ECC (Everything Claude Code) features merged into OMG**

#### New Agents — Language Reviewer Tier (8)

Eight new language-specialist review agents, each with 13–21 embedded style rules and a canonical coding standards reference:

- **@typescript-reviewer** — strict mode, no-any, exhaustive discriminated unions
- **@python-reviewer** — PEP 8, type hints, idiomatic patterns
- **@rust-reviewer** — ownership, borrow checker, unsafe justification
- **@go-reviewer** — idiomatic Go, goroutine safety, explicit error handling
- **@java-reviewer** — SOLID, Spring patterns, null safety
- **@csharp-reviewer** — nullable analysis, async/await, C# idioms
- **@swift-reviewer** — Swift concurrency, memory safety, SwiftUI patterns
- **@database-reviewer** — query performance, parameterization, schema design

#### New Skills (4)

- **`/tdd`** — Full TDD enforcement: Red-Green-Refactor cycle, framework quick-ref (Jest/pytest/Cargo/Go test), gate table with fail conditions
- **`/security-scan`** — Rapid pre-commit security sweep: secrets patterns (sk-/ghp_/AKIA), CVE audit, input validation, auth checks
- **`/coding-standards`** — Canonical cross-language coding standards (naming, functions, errors, anti-patterns, SOLID). Cited by all reviewer agents.
- **`/skill-stocktake`** — Audit skill inventory for frontmatter validity, template sync, stubs, and coverage gaps

#### Enhanced Core Agents (7)

| Agent | What Was Added |
|-------|----------------|
| **@debugger** | 7-language build resolution guide (Node/TS, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, Swift) |
| **@security-reviewer** | Secrets detection regex patterns, JWT/session/crypto rules, OWASP annotations |
| **@qa-tester** | Playwright Page Object Model pattern, E2E classification table |
| **@writer** | CODEMAP generation template + auto-update workflow |
| **@code-reviewer** | Canonical D9 coding standards table embedded |
| **@test-engineer** | Framework detection table, coverage gap protocol, flaky test root causes |
| **@code-simplifier** | Complexity metrics table, simplification patterns, stability exceptions |

#### Enhanced Skill (1)

- **`/remember`** — Quality gate added: 3-question filter (actionable? durable? unique?) before storing to project memory

#### Infrastructure

- **Tiered agent/skill thresholds** in `convention.ts`: warn <20/18, info <28/22, silent ≥28/22 (backward compatible)
- **Tree-view category grouping**: agents auto-split into "Core Agents" + "Language Reviewers" when count >20
- **Post-tool-use hook** (`OMG_LINT_ON_EDIT=1`): opt-in TypeScript typecheck + ESLint on every file edit with `FILE_PATH` sanitization guard
- **Security patches**: hono/node-server CVEs fixed, vitest upgraded to 4.1.4, `.env*` added to `.gitignore`

---

### v1.0.5 (2026-04-10)

**Bug Fix: Skill name collision with VS Code built-in Autopilot**

- **Renamed** `/autopilot` skill to `/omg-autopilot` to avoid collision with VS Code's built-in "Autopilot (Preview)" permission level
- **Fixed** invalid YAML frontmatter in all SKILL.md files: removed unsupported `allowed-tools` field, renamed `hint` to `argument-hint` per VS Code spec
- **Root cause**: The skill name `autopilot` triggered VS Code's internal permission mode switch instead of loading the OMG skill instructions
- **Scope**: Updated skill directories, MCP server code, agent definitions, cross-references, tests, and all documentation
