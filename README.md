## What is OMG?

**oh-my-githubcopilot (OMG)** brings the multi-agent orchestration paradigm — pioneered by [oh-my-claudecode (OMC)](https://github.com/yeachan-heo/oh-my-claudecode) for Claude Code — to **GitHub Copilot**.

Where OMC supercharges Claude Code with specialized agents and workflow automation, OMG does the same for Copilot's agent mode in VS Code. Instead of a single assistant doing everything, OMG coordinates **20 specialized agents** and **18 reusable skills** through an MCP server, giving you structured workflows for planning, execution, review, and verification — all within your existing Copilot setup.

> **This is not a fork or copy of OMC.** It is an independent implementation built from scratch to leverage GitHub Copilot's agent customization features (`.agent.md`, `.prompt.md`, `SKILL.md`, MCP tools) while drawing architectural inspiration from OMC's multi-agent approach.

---

## Why OMG?

- **Works inside VS Code** — No extra CLI tools, no external processes. Just Copilot agent mode.
- **Specialized agents** — 20 purpose-built agents with scoped access (read-only analysts, full-access executors)
- **Workflow automation** — From autonomous `omg-autopilot` to persistent `ralph` loops to parallel `ultrawork`
- **Safety guardrails** — Pre/post tool-use hooks prevent destructive operations automatically
- **MCP-powered state** — Persistent workflow state, PRD tracking, and project memory across sessions
- **Natural language triggers** — Say "omg-autopilot build me a REST API" and the system handles orchestration
- **Verification-first** — Separate authoring and review passes; claims require evidence

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat enabled
- Agent mode / agent customization support available in your Copilot setup
- Node.js and npm installed so the MCP server can be built locally
- Workspace opened as a trusted folder so MCP, prompts, and customization files can load normally

### Step 1: Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmstar85/oh-my-githubcopilot.git
cd oh-my-githubcopilot
```

### Step 2: Build the MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Open in VS Code

Open the project in VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat enabled. The MCP server, agents, skills, and hooks are automatically detected from the workspace configuration.

### Step 4: Start building

In Copilot Chat (agent mode), just say:

```
omg-autopilot: build a REST API for managing tasks
```

That's it. OMG takes over — planning, implementing, reviewing, and verifying.

### Not Sure Where to Start?

If your requirements are vague or you want structured clarification:

```
deep-interview "I want to build a task management app"
```

OMG uses Socratic questioning to surface hidden assumptions and clarify requirements before any code is written.

### Use OMG in Other VS Code Projects

OMG is workspace-scoped, so the recommended way is to apply it per project.

This repository now includes an adoption script:

```bash
scripts/omg-adopt.sh --target <your-project-path> --mode <template|submodule|subtree>
```

#### Tip 1: Template-style for new projects

Use this for greenfield projects where you want OMG files copied directly into the project.

```bash
scripts/omg-adopt.sh --target ~/work/my-new-app --mode template
```

#### Tip 2: Track updates with submodule or subtree

Use one of these when you want a sync strategy for future OMG updates.

```bash
# Submodule strategy
scripts/omg-adopt.sh --target ~/work/my-app --mode submodule

# Subtree strategy
scripts/omg-adopt.sh --target ~/work/my-app --mode subtree
```

What the script applies to the target project:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.github/agents/`
- `.github/skills/`
- `.github/hooks/`
- `.github/prompts/`
- `.vscode/mcp.json`
- `mcp-server/` (with `npm install && npm run build`, unless `--skip-build`)

After applying, open the target project as a trusted workspace and validate in Copilot Chat (agent mode):

```text
/status
```

### Workflow Skills

| Skill | What It Does | Trigger Keywords |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `/omg-autopilot` | Full autonomous execution from idea to working code | `omg-autopilot`, `build me`, `create me` |

## MCP Server

OMG includes a TypeScript MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides persistent state management for workflows. Registered via `.vscode/mcp.json`, it exposes tools for:

| Tool Group | Tools | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **State** | `omg_read_state`, `omg_write_state`, `omg_clear_state`, `omg_list_active` | Workflow state CRUD and active mode listing |
| **PRD** | `omg_create_prd`, `omg_read_prd`, `omg_update_story`, `omg_verify_story` | PRD creation, story tracking, and verification |
| **Workflow** | `omg_check_completion`, `omg_next_phase`, `omg_get_phase_info` | Phase transitions, completion checks, phase inspection |
| **Memory** | `omg_read_memory`, `omg_write_memory`, `omg_delete_memory` | Project-scoped knowledge persistence |
| **Model Router** | `omg_select_model` | Model recommendation based on task complexity |

State is stored under `.omc/` in the workspace:

```
.omc/
├── state/              # Workflow state files per mode
├── plans/              # Work plans for execution
├── prd.json            # Product Requirements Document
└── project-memory.json # Project-scoped knowledge store
```

---

## Tool Guardrails

OMG includes pre/post tool-use hooks (`.github/hooks/`) that act as safety nets:

**Pre-tool-use guards:**
- Blocks modifications to `node_modules/`
- Prevents direct `.env` file edits
- Stops deletion of critical config files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`)
- Prevents `git push --force` and destructive git operations

**Post-tool-use tracking:**
- Logs tool usage for debugging (`OMG_DEBUG=1`)
- Tracks file modifications for omg-autopilot phase awareness
- Monitors test results for ultraqa detection

```

### How It Works

1. **Instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) define the orchestration rules, delegation logic, and agent catalog
2. **Agents** (`.github/agents/*.agent.md`) are specialized personas with scoped tool access and model preferences
3. **Skills** (`.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`) are workflow routines loaded on-demand via keyword triggers or slash commands
4. **MCP Server** provides persistent state, PRD tracking, and project memory via the Model Context Protocol
5. **Hooks** guard against destructive operations and track execution for workflow awareness

---

## Commit Protocol

OMG uses structured git trailers to preserve decision context:

```
fix(auth): prevent silent session drops during long-running ops

Auth service returns inconsistent status codes on token expiry,
so the interceptor catches all 4xx and triggers inline refresh.

Constraint: Auth service does not support token introspection
Rejected: Extend token TTL to 24h | security policy violation
Confidence: high
Scope-risk: narrow
```

Available trailers: `Constraint`, `Rejected`, `Directive`, `Confidence`, `Scope-risk`, `Not-tested`

## Comparison with OMC

| Feature | OMC (oh-my-claudecode) | OMG (oh-my-githubcopilot) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Target Platform | Claude Code CLI | GitHub Copilot (VS Code) |
| Installation | npm package / plugin marketplace | Clone + build MCP server |
| Agent Count | 19+ (with tier variants) | 20 specialized agents |
| Skills | 10+ workflow skills | 18 skills with keyword triggers |
| State Management | `.omc/` directory | `.omc/` via MCP server (same path for OMC compatibility) |
| Multi-model | Codex/Gemini via tmux CLI | ccg skill (advisory) |
| Configuration | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.github/` + `.vscode/mcp.json` |
| Tool Safety | Plugin-level hooks | Pre/post shell hooks |
| HUD / Statusline | Built-in HUD | VS Code native |

---

## Requirements

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension
- GitHub Copilot Chat with agent mode enabled
- Node.js 18+ (for the MCP server)

---

## What's New

### v1.0.5 (2026-04-10)

**Bug Fix: Skill name collision with VS Code built-in Autopilot**

- **Renamed** `/autopilot` skill to `/omg-autopilot` to avoid collision with VS Code's built-in "Autopilot (Preview)" permission level
- **Fixed** invalid YAML frontmatter in all SKILL.md files: removed unsupported `allowed-tools` field, renamed `hint` to `argument-hint` per VS Code spec
- **Root cause**: The skill name `autopilot` triggered VS Code's internal permission mode switch instead of loading the OMG skill instructions
- **Scope**: Updated skill directories, MCP server code, agent definitions, cross-references, tests, and all documentation
